# Fox-Quotes - A mod for Minecraft that overrides the defaulf splashes.txt with over two thousand quotes from our community, for use with the JCIR minecraft server.

## Extending a grand Thank you for the folks whom have contributed features and code (and overall just time and effort):
- Bidahochi
- TBEA

## And a big thank you for the many users past and present who have said the most unhinged and stupid things to make all these quoteworthy quotes!

### Fox-Quotes's current server home is JC's Industrial Railroading, where most of the mods development work occurs and is posted. However, a Discord server does exist purely for the mod itself, which is somewhat active.
