# Fox-Quotes - A mod for Minecraft, based on JCIR-Traincraft, in turn based on Traincraft.

## Extending a grand Thank you for the folks whom have contributed features and code (and overall just time and effort):

- TBEA

### Fox-Quotes's current server home is JC's Industrial Railroading, where most of the mods development work occurs and is posted. However, a Discord server does exist purely for the mod itself, which is somewhat active.
